        <h3>Does it sound a bit scary?</h3>
        <p>Wondering if you want to compete, or whether it's right for you? Concerned about the thought of dancing in front of all those other people? <strong>Relax</strong> - we hear this from our beginners every year, but there's really nothing to worry about - it's all in the mind. Past members have always come out with a positive result and find they can't wait for the next competition! Read on to find out how to take part.</p>
      </div>
       <div class="grid_4">
        <p>Each year we take part in various competitions on the university circuit. Some of these are hosted by individual universities; others - like SUDC and IVDC below - are organised by University Dancesport and are much larger affairs.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <p>At these competitions you get the opportunity to show off all of your dance skills and dress up to look the part! Anyone can take part, and you always dance against other people at the same level as you. Other than competing in pairs you can also be a part of Surrey's team!</p>

        <h3>Inter-varsity friendlies</h3>
        <p>Not quite as large as nationals, these are hosted by individual universities and are usually attended by just a few teams from universities who are relatively local to that competition.</p>
        <p>At minimum we go to Bath's winter competition, which also happens to be accompanied by a fabulous Christmas Ball in the evening.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Inter-varsity nationals</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>the Southern Universities Dance Competition (SUDC) where all the southern universities (that's every one below and including Birmingham) join the fray</li>
          <li>the Inter Varsity Dance Competition (IVDC) at the Winter Gardens Ballroom, Blackpool, which all the universities throughout the country come to</li>
        </ul>

      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>ISTD medallist circuit</h3>
        <p>Outside of university competitions, you can join our teachers and their school (Dancerite) at ISTD competitions up and down the country.</p>
        <p>These are a little different and consist of <strong>solo</strong> events, where you dance with a teacher and are marked on your individual merits, and <strong>couples</strong> events where you dance as a couple and are marked together.</p>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>If you are thinking about competing we recommend that you purchase proper dancing shoes with suede soles - they will significantly improve how you dance.</p>
        <p>In all cases the competition organisers are quite keen to protect their floor surfaces, so they insist that all competitors wear <strong>non-marking shoes</strong>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Guys</h3>
        <p>The first pair of shoes you buy should be <strong>ballroom</strong> shoes since they also work for the Latin American dances. (Seriously, big heel leads in Cuban heels lead to falling over.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Girls</h3>
        <p>The opposite - your first pair should be <strong>Latin</strong> shoes as these can be worn to do ballroom dancing as well.</p>
        <p>You will also need <strong>heel protectors</strong> for your shoes before the competitions. It is important to know the style of your heel to purchase the correct heel protectors; you can find this out when you buy the shoes.</strong>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>To make everything fairer at Beginner and Novice levels of the University competition circuit, all dancers must wear non-competitive dress - that means nothing with sparkles! But at Intermediate, Advanced and Ex Student levels, anything goes.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure, we recommend you always get a member of committee, or a teacher, to check what you're going to wear beforehand.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Guys</h3>
        <p>A crisp, clean (and preferably ironed!) white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and either a normal tie or bow tie would be a good place to start.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Girls</h3>
        <p>At Beginner and Novice levels, a dress or skirt and top is acceptable as long as they are unpatterned and do not contain rhinestones or fringing. For Ballroom, a longer skirt is required, although you may be able to borrow a Ballroom skirt from the club.</p>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>If your hair is naturally springy or bouncy, or if you have any tufts which stick up by themselves, you will need to tame it with the liberal application of hair gel. (A walking haystack doesn't impress the judges.)</p>
        <p>Do not worry - there will be plenty of people to help you with your hair on the day if necessary!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Guys</h3>
        <p>Hair gel too please - no loose stands either.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Girls</h3>
        <p>Your hair needs to be tied back in a tight bun, with all loose strands gelled/hair sprayed down, away from your face. Among other things this stops it swishing around and ending up all over your partner! A hair net is a good way to keep the bun neat and tidy, with lots of hair grips! You are allowed to add hair-slides with some sparkle or decoration on them.</p>

### Tanning
Competitions invariably take place under powerful spotlights, so unless youre lucky enough to have a suitably dark complexion naturally youll look about as white as scared milk! This is where the wonders of artificial tanning come in to play... yes, even for the men.
If you have fair skin, you will need to either spray tan or use tinted moisturiser in the lead up to the competition. The more the better, you will soon realise that everyone else is more orange than you when you get there!
- Girls: you can wear tanned tights instead of tanning your legs but the arms, chest and back will need to be fake tanned.


### Make up
Make up needs to be quite heavy. Use foundation/bronzer on your face to make sure the lights do not wash out your skin. Eye shadow, eye liner and mascara all help to give off a professional look and first impressions mean everything in competitions. Some lipstick will finish off the make-up perfectly.
