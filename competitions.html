  <h2><i class="icon-trophy"></i> Competitions</h2>
  <p>Wondering if you want to compete, or whether it's right for you? Concerned about the thought of dancing in front of all those other people? <strong>Relax</strong> - we hear this from our beginners every year, but there's really nothing to worry about - it's all in the mind. Past members have always come out with a positive result and find they can't wait for the next competition! Read on to find out how to take part.</p>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>If you are thinking about competing we recommend that you purchase proper dancing shoes with suede soles - they will significantly improve how you dance.</p>
        <p>In all cases the competition organisers are quite keen to protect their floor surfaces, so they insist that all competitors wear <strong>non-marking shoes</strong>.</p>

      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Guys</h3>
        <p>The first pair of shoes you buy should be <strong>ballroom</strong> shoes since they also work for the Latin American dances. (Seriously, big heel leads in Cuban heels lead to falling over.)</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Girls</h3>
        <p>The opposite - your first pair should be <strong>Latin</strong> shoes as these can be worn to do ballroom dancing as well.</p>
        <p>You will also need <strong>heel protectors</strong> for your shoes before the competitions. It is important to know the style of your heel to purchase the correct heel protectors; you can find this out when you buy the shoes.</strong>

        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>To make everything fairer at Beginner and Novice levels of the University competition circuit, all dancers must wear non-competitive dress - that means nothing with sparkles! But at Intermediate, Advanced and Ex Student levels, anything goes.</p>
        <p>If you're not sure, we recommend you always get a member of committee, or a teacher, to check what you're going to wear beforehand.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Guys</h3>
        <p>A crisp, clean (and preferably ironed!) white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and either a normal tie or bow tie would be a good place to start.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Girls</h3>
        <p>At Beginner and Novice levels, a dress or skirt and top is acceptable as long as they are unpatterned and do not contain rhinestones or fringing. For Ballroom, a longer skirt is required, although you may be able to borrow a Ballroom skirt from the club.</p>

      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>General</h3>
        <p>If your hair is naturally springy or bouncy, or if you have any tufts which stick up by themselves, you will need to tame it with the liberal application of hair gel. (A walking haystack doesn't impress the judges.)</p>
        <p>Do not worry - there will be plenty of people to help you with your hair on the day if necessary!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Guys</h3>
        <p>Hair gel too please - no loose stands either.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_4">
        <h3>Girls</h3>
        <p>Your hair needs to be tied back in a tight bun, with all loose strands gelled/hair sprayed down, away from your face. Among other things this stops it swishing around and ending up all over your partner! A hair net is a good way to keep the bun neat and tidy, with lots of hair grips! You are allowed to add hair-slides with some sparkle or decoration on them.</p>

        <h3>Make-up</h3>
        <p>(This bit's largely for the benefit of the girls.)</p>
        <p>Make-up needs to be quite heavy to make sure the lighting does not wash out your skin.
        <ul>
          <li>use foundation/bronzer on your face and don't spare it</li>
          <li>eye shadow, eye liner and mascara all help to give off a professional look and first impressions mean everything in competitions</li>
          <li>some lipstick will finish off the job perfectly</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="grid_6">
        <h3>Tanning</h3>
        <p>Yeah, we just said it... don't laugh! Newsreaders and other people on TV do it to normalise their skin tone under the bright studio lights.</p>
        <p>Competitions have similarly unforgiving lighting, so unless you have a suitably dark complexion naturally you'll look about as white as scared milk! This is where the wonders of artificial tanning come in to play... yes, even for the men.</p>
        <p>If you have fair skin, you will need to either spray tan or use tinted moisturiser in the lead up to the competition. Don't worry though, you'll see that everyone else is more orange than you when you get there!</p>
