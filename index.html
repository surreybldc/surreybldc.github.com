        <h3>Who we are</h3>
        <p>We are the University of Surrey's Ballroom and Latin American dance club. Since <a href="/about.html" title="See the club's history">1998</a> we've offered competitions, classes, socials, performances and a whole lot more inbetween to all of our members.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>All students welcome</h3>
        <p>That's right - any current student at Surrey can join, and <em>no gym membership is required</em> so it's cheap too. <strong>Your first session is always free, so give it a go!</strong> And whether you can only make it once a week or you want to go all out, we've got something for you.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Do I need prior experience?</h3>
        <p>Not at all! Whether you've been a dancer for years or you don't know your left foot from your right foot, you'll always be welcome and we have something to suit every level of ability.</p>

    <h2>We offer modern ballroom...</h2>

        <img src="/img/1920s_night.jpg" alt="Modern ballroom dancers">
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Viennese Waltz</h3>
        <p>An elegant and fast-flowing dance born in Vienna, which the aristocracy danced to music by Strauss and other classical composers. The steps are simple, but at double the speed of the "English" slow waltz it's all about the stamina!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Tango</h3>
        <p>A passionate Argentinian dance originally banned for being too scandalous, characterized by a cat-like walking action - our teacher Vicki describes it as "a wholly different animal" to the other dances.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Waltz</h3>
        <p>A slow, romantic ballroom style dance which started in Vienna, and later developed into the Slow English Waltz. Danced to a signature 3/4 beat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Quickstep</h3>
        <p>A fun and lively English style ballroom dance with fast movement, including a variety of hops, kicks, skips, lock steps and chasses.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Foxtrot</h3>
        <p>Characterised by silky smooth, flowing, walking-style movements, and danced to the likes of Frank Sinatra.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>...and Latin American...</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <img src="/img/latin-web.jpg" alt="Latin American dancers">
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Cha cha</h3>
        <p>An upbeat, feisty, and syncopated dance, deriving its name and character from its distinct repetitive foot rhythm. Usually danced to pop and club music.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Jive</h3>
        <p>A popular, fast and exhilarating dance originating in the 50's from the American GI's, and often danced to rock 'n' roll music.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Rumba</h3>
        <p>The fascinating rhythms and sexually provocative hip and body expressions make this one of the most sensuous Latin dances.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Paso Doble</h3>
        <p>A dramatic "Spanish bullfight", where the man plays the bull and the lady his cape. Usually danced to "Espana Cani", the Spanish Gypsy Dance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Samba</h3>
        <p>A rhythmical and distinctive Brazilian dance combining traditional Latin hip action with a trademark "bounce".</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>...and a few other styles too!</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol attention">
        <h3>Availability</h3>
        <p>The following styles are offered depending on the demand from our members, but we always do our best to deliver them.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Rock 'n' roll</h3>
        <p>Non-acrobatic rock 'n' roll is a more energetic and freestyle variant of the jive (above), including kicks, spins, twists and cross-steps. We did say "energetic" - once you've danced rock n' roll, you'll know you've had a serious workout.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Offbeat</h3>
        <p>If you've done any jazz dance before, you'll feel right at home! This is a more freeform and general dance style that contrasts strongly with the more prescribed "choreography syllabus" of ballroom or Latin.</p>

        <p>Not quite as large as nationals, these are hosted by individual universities and are usually attended by just a few teams from universities who are relatively local to that competition.</p>
        <p>At minimum we go to <a href="http://www.uoblbdc.com" title="University of Bath Latin and Ballroom Dance Club">Bath's</a> winter competition, which also happens to be accompanied by a Christmas Ball!</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>solo</strong> events where you dance with a teacher and are marked on your individual merits;</li>
          <li><strong>couples</strong> events where two students dance together and are marked jointly.</li>
