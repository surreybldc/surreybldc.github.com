        <p>Team Surrey's on the loose again and going for gold! Two of our most enthusiastic dancers, Michael and Lauren, made the final in every competition Surrey attended&mdash;and won in the Novice category at Blackpool! A committee headed up by Julia, Nicole and Elena ably took the club through numerous performances for the first time, including the university's international festival, while teachers Vicki and Fredric spearheaded our first attempt at competitive rock n' roll with Chris and Eleftheria reaching the finals at Blackpool too. All in all a very successful year&mdash;keep watching, because we're only just getting started!</p>

        <p>Jess Lee became president in the first half of the year, leading a strong and fresh new committee which (we think) set the club on its way to better things! We kicked off with a major technical overhaul and a shiny new WordPress-powered website, and followed up that by recruiting more punters than the rugby club at Active Freshers' Fayre! Sadly Jess's final year overwhelmed her with work eventually and in February we elected a new President (Liz Lerew), Vice President (Abi Wilson) and two new Social Secs (Tamsin Harding and Julia Janikova).</p>

With new blood alongside the wisdom and experience of 2 ex-presidents, the committee promises to deliver big things! The men are taking charge this year with Stuart at the helm, supported by Phil H, Lynn, Agneiszka, Irene and Nat... watch this space!</p>

        <p>Sarah had the role of President this year and true to form for BDS presidents she did a sterling job, and was rewarded with president of the year at the 2005 USSU Students Awards. With the help of Caroline, Neil and Nate the club grew from strength to strength with a massive 60+ dancers at beginners classes! This is no mean feat and the top tuition from Tony had a lot to do with it. Comps and socials were plentiful and dancing was good :0) The year ended on a sad note with the departure of Tony as beginner teacher, he will be sorely missed!</p>

        <p>The club continued to grow under the watchful eye of Natalie. There was an addition of 2 classes a week, receiving a great consistent turnout throughout the year. We entered 6 competitions, bringing home too many trophies to count! The social side boomed as well with 2 fab balls and some great events throughout the year. To cap it off ALL of the committee won awards at Union Annual Awards (Nate, Rob, Sam and Natalie).</p>

The climax was 100 members in 2003 and President of the Year to Miss Gemma Pearce.</p>

        <h3>1998&ndash;2000</h3>
        <p>With Danusia and Lynn at the helm, the club ran a weekly lesson on a Wednesday with Mary Parker and occasionally the lovely Bill. The lessons were fun and mainly focussed on medal routines. Although occasionally, when numbers were down, it was a pint in Roots that won our attention.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Around 1998</h3>
        <p>A lovely German gent named Steve Wesemeyer came to Surrey from Exeter and was appalled at the lack of ballroom dancing. So he got together with CampuSport to relight the dancing flame here at Surrey.</p>

      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Before 1997</h3>
        <p>The club did exist (as Mr Howard will testify) but ceased to be around this time.</p>
