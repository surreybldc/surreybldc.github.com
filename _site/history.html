  <h2 id='a_little_history'>A little history</h2>

<p>From humble beginnings in 1998 we&#8217;ve built ourselves up year after year to form the club you know today.</p>

<h3 id='20102011'>2010-2011</h3>

<p>Jess Lee became president in the first half of the year, leading a strong and fresh new committee which (we think) set the club on its way to better things! We kicked off with a major technical overhaul and a shiny new WordPress-powered website, and followed up that by recruiting more punters than the rugby club at Active Freshers&#8217; Fayre! Sadly Jess&#8217;s final year overwhelmed her with work eventually and in February we elected a new President (Liz Lerew), Vice President (Abi Wilson) and two new Social Secs (Tamsin Harding and Julia Janikova).</p>

<h3 id='20092010'>2009-2010</h3>

<p>The Surrey team lineup at IVDC 2010, Blackpool Alex Rainer takes charge, with Jess Lee (VP) and Lea Carrott (club secretary) assisting. Under the guidance of new teachers Vicki and Fredric Frennessen, the team saw reasonable successes on the competition circuit. Surrey B danced their way to a medallist&#8217;s finish in the IVDC team match and we were all pretty chuffed with that!</p>

<h3 id='20072008'>2007-2008</h3>

<p>While having to say goodbye to Vincent and Flavia with their new fame, the new committee of Catherine, Paul and Alex are excited to welcome fresh new teachers! The club sees Mal returning to teach the beginners class and are sure his enthusiasm for dance will be an inspiration to many!</p>

<h3 id='20062007'>2006-2007</h3>

<p>BDS (Ballroom Dancing Society) becomes BLD (Ballroom &amp; Latin Dancing) as the society is transformed to club status. 2 of our principal teachers, Vincent Simone and Flavia Cacace, appear on &#8220;Strictly Come Dancing&#8221;.</p>

<h3 id='20052006'>2005-2006</h3>

<p>A year for old and new, a change in class structure and teachers is just the beginning of the plans for this year! With new blood alongside the wisdom and experience of 2 ex-presidents, the committee promises to deliver big things! The men are taking charge this year with Stuart at the helm, supported by Phil H, Lynn, Agneiszka, Irene and Nat&#8230; watch this space!</p>

<h3 id='20042005'>2004-2005</h3>

<p>Sarah had the role of President this year and true to form for BDS presidents she did a sterling job, and was rewarded with president of the year at the 2005 USSU Students Awards. With the help of Caroline, Neil and Nate the club grew from strength to strength with a massive 60+ dancers at beginners classes! This is no mean feat and the top tuition from Tony had a lot to do with it. Comps and socials were plentiful and dancing was good :0) The year ended on a sad note with the departure of Tony as beginner teacher, he will be sorely missed!</p>

<h3 id='20032004'>2003-2004</h3>

<p>The club continued to grow under the watchful eye of Natalie. There was an addition of 2 classes a week, receiving a great consistent turnout throughout the year. We entered 6 competitions, bringing home too many trophies to count! The social side boomed as well with 2 fab balls and some great events throughout the year. To cap it off ALL of the committee won awards at Union Annual Awards (Nate, Rob, Sam and Natalie).</p>

<h3 id='20002003'>2000-2003</h3>

<p>The winds of change came to Surrey and the club gained some new teachers - Tony, Vincent and Flavia. Lynn and Gemma had their turns in power pushing the club forward with improved classes, socials and competitions and a great committee (Nate, Hannah and Natalie) at the heart of it. The climax was 100 members in 2003 and President of the Year to Miss Gemma Pearce.</p>

<h3 id='19982000'>1998-2000</h3>

<p>With Danusia and Lynn at the helm, the club ran a weekly lesson on a Wednesday with Mary Parker and occasionally the lovely Bill. The lessons were fun and mainly focussed on medal routines. Although occasionally, when numbers were down, it was a pint in Roots that won our attention.</p>

<h3 id='around_1998'>Around 1998</h3>

<p>A lovely German gent named Steve Wesemeyer came to Surrey from Exeter and was appalled at the lack of ballroom dancing. So he got together with CampuSport to relight the dancing flame here at Surrey.</p>

<h3 id='before_1997'>Before 1997</h3>

<p>The club did exist (as Mr Howard will testify) but ceased to be around this time.</p>
