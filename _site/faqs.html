  <h2>Some common questions</h2>
<div class="speech">
  <div class="row">
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>I'm not a student, can I still dance?</h3>
      <p>As a student club part funded by the Student's Union our priority is to offer dancing to students, but do ask - membership for non-students is at the discretion of the committee.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>What standard do I have to be?</h3>
      <p>Any! We cater for complete beginners with no coordination, to the very advanced. Our teachers can teach you from any level, to any level.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>Can I try before I buy?</h3>
      <p>Definitely! The first lesson for anyone that's not been before (to our society lessons) is free, so you can see what we do and consider whether or not you'd like to come again.</p>
    </section>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>What do I pay for?</h3>
      <p>Add answer here after analysing budget<!--The society gets some money from the students' union to subsidise the lessons, but it doesn't cover it all. Therefore all your money goes towards the lessons you're attending. Nothing goes on social events, because not everyone will take advantage of the socials, and nothing goes on competition entry or travel. Those areas are again subsidised by the Union, and competitors contribute a minimal fee towards it.--></p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>What dance styles are there?</h3>
      <p>We offer Ballroom, Latin American, and (depending on participation) Rock n' Roll and Offbeat as extras.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>Do I need to purchase membership?</h3>
      <p>We always recommend you do - you can receive deals that make classes work out cheaper for you. If you are competing you <strong>must</strong> be a member as the price includes insurance.</p>
    </section>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>What is the beginners' class?</h3>
      <p>The beginner classes are aimed at absolute beginners and will gradually work through various dances with progression through the year.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>And what's accelerated beginners?</h3>
      <p>The accelerated beginners class runs at a faster rate for dancers with some previous experience, or for anyone who's particularly eager to learn.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>I've been a dancer for years</h3>
      <p>For specific information for more advanced dancers please contact us directly.</p>
    </section>
  </div>
  <div class="row">
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>What are the medals?</h3>
      <p>At the end of the year you are able to take an ISTD medallist exam which will give you a more permanent memento of your achievements with us that you can put on your CV. For more information see the medals page.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>What if I'm struggling?</h3>
      <p>Everyone struggles at the beginning, and even after the going gets tough sometimes. The best advice to you if you really want to dance is to STICK AT IT - it takes time, but in the long run you'll have the confidence to dance to almost anything!</p>
    </section>
    <section class="grid_4">
      <h3>I've got a question not answered here</h3>
      <p>Then drop us an email or find us on Facebook, and we'll see if we can answer it. If we don't know the answer ourselves, we'll pass it along to someone who does.</p>
