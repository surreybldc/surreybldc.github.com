  <h2 id='some_common_questions'>Some common questions</h2>

<h3 id='im_not_a_student_can_i_still_dance'>I&#8217;m not a student, can I still dance?</h3>

<p>Whilst we do cater for students and non-students, as a student society part funded by the University of Surrey Student&#8217;s Union our priority is to offer dancing to students. We encourage all students to become members (it&#8217;s cheaper for you that way!), but membership for non-students is at the discretion of the committee.</p>

<h3 id='what_standard_do_i_have_to_be'>What standard do I have to be?</h3>

<p>Any! We cater for complete beginners with no coordination, to the very advanced. Our teachers can teach you from any level, to any level.</p>

<h3 id='can_i_try_before_i_buy'>Can I try before I buy?</h3>

<p>Definitely! The first lesson for anyone that&#8217;s not been before (to our society lessons) is free, so you can see what we do and consider whether or not you&#8217;d like to come again.</p>

<h3 id='what_do_i_pay_for'>What do I pay for?</h3>

<p>The society gets some money from the students&#8217; union to subsidise the lessons, but it doesn&#8217;t cover it all. Therefore all your money goes towards the lessons you&#8217;re attending. Nothing goes on social events, because not everyone will take advantage of the socials, and nothing goes on competition entry or travel. Those areas are again subsidised by the Union, and competitors contribute a minimal fee towards it.</p>

<h3 id='what_dancing_is_there'>What dancing is there?</h3>

<p>We offer Ballroom, Latin American, and (depending on participation) Rock n&#8217; Roll and Offbeat as extras. The beginner classes are aimed at absolute beginners and will gradually work through various dances with progression through the year. The accelerated beginners class runs at a faster rate for dancers with some previous experience, or for anyone who&#8217;s particularly eager to learn. For specific information for more advanced dancers please contact us directly.</p>

<h3 id='what_are_the_medals'>What are the medals?</h3>

<p>At the end of the year you are able to take an ISTD medallist exam which will give you a more permanent memento of your achievements with us that you can put on your CV. For more information see the medals page.</p>

<h3 id='what_if_im_struggling'>What if I&#8217;m struggling?</h3>

<p>Everyone struggles at the beginning, and even after that we all go through times where no progress seems to be made. The best advice to you if you really want to dance is to STICK AT IT! It does take a long time to become really good but the journey is worth it in the long run because you will have the confidence to dance to almost anything!</p>

<h3 id='ive_got_a_question_not_answered_here'>I&#8217;ve got a question not answered here</h3>

<p>Then drop us an email or find us on Facebook, and we&#8217;ll see if we can answer it. If we don&#8217;t know the answer ourselves, we&#8217;ll pass it along to someone who does.</p>
