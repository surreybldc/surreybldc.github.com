  <section>
    <h2>Classes</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol attention">
        <h3>When and where are your classes?</h3>
        <p>As times and rooms tend to vary, we send an email each week with the details of what's on. <a href="http://signup.surreybldc.com">Sign up</a> to the mailing list to receive these emails.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>What is the beginners' class?</h3>
        <p>The beginner classes are aimed at absolute beginners and will gradually work through various dances with progression through the year.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>What's the advanced class?</h3>
        <p>This one caters for everyone from IVDA "Novice" level (who are moving up from Beginners) to those with quite a bit of prior dance experience.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Can I get private lessons?</h3>
        <p>Definitely, but for those you'll need to get in contact with our <strong>teachers</strong> directly. Go to their website or ask them in person for more details.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Is there any practice outside lessons?</h3>
        <p>There is indeed, and it normally happens on Thursday evenings. It's a completely free session with no teachers for you to go over anything you're not sure about. The exact time and location is announced each week on our mailing list and on Facebook.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Anything else?</h3>
        <p>Yes - our teachers have their own dance school, and teach in Basingstoke on Tuesday evenings and Camberley on Thursday evenings. If you can get to either of them, it's a useful extra.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <section>
    <h2>Money</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Can I try before I buy?</h3>
        <p>Definitely! The first lesson for anyone that's not been before is free, so you can see what we do and consider whether or not you'd like to come again.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>Do I need to purchase membership?</h3>
        <p>If you've tried it and want to carry on, you will need one as the price includes insurance - you are <em>highly unlikely</em> to get injured, but it does very occasionally happen. Members also receive <strong>discounts</strong> that make classes work out cheaper!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>Do I need a gym (SSP) membership too?</h3>
        <p><strong>Nope</strong> - as we are not a Surrey Sports Park club, you don't need a gym membership to join us. Our one-off membership fee is a fraction of the cost, and goes straight back into providing more for our members.</p>

    <h2>Eligibility</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>I'm not a (Surrey) student, can I still dance?</h3>
        <p>As a student club part funded by the Student's Union our priority is to offer dancing to students, but do ask - membership for non-students is at the discretion of the committee.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>What standard do I have to be?</h3>
        <p>Any! We cater for complete beginners with no coordination, to the very advanced. Our teachers can teach you from any level, to any level.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol last">
        <h3>What if I'm struggling?</h3>
        <p>Everyone struggles at the beginning, and even after the going gets tough sometimes. The best advice to you if you really want to dance is to STICK AT IT - it takes time, but in the long run you'll have the confidence to dance to almost anything!</p>

    <h2>Other questions</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>What dance styles are there?</h3>
        <p>We offer Ballroom, Latin American, and (depending on participation) Rock n' Roll and Offbeat as extras.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="fourcol">
        <h3>What are the medals?</h3>
        <p>At the end of the year you are able to take an ISTD medallist exam which will give you a more permanent memento of your achievements with us that you can put on your CV. Contact us for more information.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>I've got a question not answered here</h3>
        <p>Then <a href="mailto:ussu.ballroom@surrey.ac.uk">drop us an email</a> or find us on Facebook, and we'll see if we can answer it. If we don't know the answer ourselves, we'll pass it along to someone who does.</p>
