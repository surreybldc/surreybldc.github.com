## Competitions
Wondering if you want to compete, or whether it's right for you? Concerned about the thought of dancing in front of all those other people? Relax - we hear this from our beginners every year, but there's really nothing to worry about - it's all in the mind. Past members have always come out with a positive result and find they can't wait for the next competition! Read on to find out how to take part.

## The main events
Each year we take part in various competitions on the university circuit. Some of these are hosted by individual universities; others - like the two below - are organised by University Dancesport and are much larger affairs:
- the Southern Universities Dance Competition (SUDC) where all the southern universities (that's every one below and including Birmingham) join the fray
- the Inter Varsity Dance Competition (IVDC) at the Winter Gardens Ballroom, Blackpool, which all the universities throughout the country come to

At these competitions you get the opportunity to show off all of your dance skills and dress up to look the part! Anyone can take part, and youll always dance against other people at the same level as you. Other than competing in pairs you can also be a part of Surrey's team!

## Competition advice

### Shoes
In all cases the competition organisers are quite keen to protect their floor surfaces, so they insist that all competitors wear non-marking shoes and that ladies wear heel protectors. If you are thinking about competing we recommend that you purchase proper dancing shoes with suede soles - they will significantly improve how you dance.
- Guys: the first pair of shoes you buy should be ballroom shoes since they also work for the Latin American dances.
- Girls: your first pair should be Latin shoes as these can be worn to do ballroom dancing as well. You will also need to purchase heel protectors for your shoes before the competitions. It is important to know the style of your heel to purchase the correct heel protectors; you can find this out when you buy the shoes.

### Clothes
To make everything fairer at Beginner and Novice levels of the University competition circuit, all dancers must wear non-competitive dress - that means nothing with sparkles! But at Intermediate, Advanced and Ex Student levels, anything goes. If you're not sure, we recommend you always get a member of committee, or a teacher, to check what you're going to wear beforehand.
- Guys: a crisp, clean (and preferably ironed!) white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and either a normal tie or bow tie would be a good place to start.
- Girls: At Beginner and Novice levels, a dress or skirt and top is acceptable as long as they are unpatterned and do not contain rhinestones or fringing. For Ballroom, a longer skirt is required than for Latin, although you may be able to borrow a Ballroom skirt from the club.

### Tanning
Competitions invariably take place under powerful spotlights, so unless youre lucky enough to have a suitably dark complexion naturally youll look about as white as scared milk! This is where the wonders of artificial tanning come in to play... yes, even for the men.
If you have fair skin, you will need to either spray tan or use tinted moisturiser in the lead up to the competition. The more the better, you will soon realise that everyone else is more orange than you when you get there!
- Girls: you can wear tanned tights instead of tanning your legs but the arms, chest and back will need to be fake tanned.

### Hair
If your hair is naturally springy or bouncy, or if you have any tufts which stick up by themselves, you will need to tame it with the liberal application of hair gel. (A walking haystack doesn't impress the judges.)
- Girls: your hair needs to be tied back in a tight bun, with all loose strands gelled/hair sprayed down, away from your face. Among other things this stops it swishing around and ending up all over your partner! A hair net is a good way to keep the bun neat and tidy, with lots of hair grips! You are allowed to add hair-slides with some sparkle or decoration on them. Do not worry - there will be plenty of people to help you with your hair if necessary!
- Guys: hair gel too please - no loose stands either.

### Make up
Make up needs to be quite heavy. Use foundation/bronzer on your face to make sure the lights do not wash out your skin. Eye shadow, eye liner and mascara all help to give off a professional look and first impressions mean everything in competitions. Some lipstick will finish off the make-up perfectly.

### Got questions?
Ask Vicki - she was once a Training Executive for Estee Lauder so she definitely knows a thing or two about this!
